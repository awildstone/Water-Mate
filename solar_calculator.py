        Returns the JSON data in dict for this date/location.
        {"date": date, "sunrise": sunrise, "sunset": sunset, "day_length": day_length, "solar_noon": solar_noon}.

        The API will always return the data for the provided geocoordinates but in UTC time instead of the local time,
        and our application only knows dates and times that are timezone naive and assume that sunrise/sunset will
        fall on the same day (because they do).

        Therefore, adjustments are needed for different timezones to account for the fact that in some timezones sunset
        falls on the next day in UTC and in other timezones, sunrise falls on the previous day in UTC.

        Timezones -12 to +5 must add 1 day to the sunset time so that our application correctly calculates the time difference.
        This is because sunset time will fall on the following day in UTC time for these timezones.

        For example:
        - In Seattle, WA on 5/30/21 the UTC difference is -7
        - Sunrise in localtime is 5:16 AM on Sunday 5/30, but the API provided time is 12:16 PM UTC.
        - Sunset in localtime is 8:57 PM on Sunday 5/30, but the API provided time is 3:57 AM UTC.
        - Our application thinks that sunrise is 12:16 PM and sunset is 3:57 AM on 5/30 which will calculate the time difference incorrectly
        so we add a day to our sunset time so our application knows we are working with 12:16 PM 5/30 to 3:57 AM 5/31.

        Timezones +6 to +12 must subtract 1 day from the sunrise time so that our application correctly calculates the time difference.
        This is because sunrise will fall on the previous day in UTC time for these timezones.

        For example:
        - In Dhaka, Bangladesh on 5/30/21 the UTC difference is +6
        - Sunrise in localtime is 5:11 AM on Sunday 5/30, but the time provided by the API is 11:11 PM UTC.
        - Sunset in localtime is 6:40 PM on Sunday 5/20, but the API  provided time is 12:40 PM UTC.
        - Our application thinks that sunrise is 11:11 PM 5/30 and sunset is 12:40 PM 5/30 and this will calculate the time difference incorrectly
        so we subtract 1 day from sunrise so our application knows we are working with 11:11 PM 5/29 to 12:40 PM 5/30.
